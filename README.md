# UmaCard

Basic tool to compare Umamusume support cards for beginner players.

It calculates a "Total Rating" value for the selected cards based on their stats at the selected Limit Break level.

The total rating value is most definitely not accurate, but it should give a rough idea of what cards are better than others.

When I first started playing Umamusume, I couldn't understand what support cards were better or worse based on stats alone, and I wished a tool like this existed, or was at least easier to find.

## Credits
- All card data & art sourced from [GameTora](https://gametora.com/umamusume)

## Notes
- The tool was mainly created for testing and personal use.
- Probably doesn't work on all devices.
- Might update in the future to have more features, and the newer released cards.
